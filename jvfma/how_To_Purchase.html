				<h3>How purchase works</h3> 
					<p>Firstly need to be mentioned <span class="highlight">each product is per crate.</span> When you enter quantity into text box e.g. 1 then you will receive 1 crate which is 6 pack.</p>
					<p>Enter number, how many crates of juices you want to order and then press purchase button on the bottom of the page. Then if you what to change order e.g. from 2 to 3 then change number in text box to 3. and press purchase button again. When the button is press for second time it will override values that are in the text boxes. It will not add the value!</p>
					<p>When the button is pressed then it will calculate final amount of the purchase juices and add 17.5% of VAT. What more if your order is more than 5 carets the 12.5% discount would be added to the final amount?</p>
					<p>The maximum of the crates that can be ordered is 999 crates. If there are any circumstances that you wish to purchase more crates then thousand just contact us personally.</p>
					<p>Into quantity text box can by enter numbers from 1 to 999. If you do not want the product then keep it empty. <span class="highlight">Do not enter 0!</span> If you enter 0 into quantity text box then than calculation would not be processed and it will appear a warning message. In same way it works if any letter or character would be entered into quantity text box.</p>
